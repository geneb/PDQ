                          MAKEPDQ Instructions

    The compiling and linking process is getting more and more complex,
especially if you want to optimize your programs for size.  With all the
stub files and optional library files to choose from, it is not easy to
type in everything correctly every time...

    I have written this menu-driven interface that simplifies the task of
compiling and linking.  You simply use pull-down menus to choose the compiler
and linker options you want to use, the alternate libraries, and the string
pool and stub files.  These are selected by checking the options from a
pull-down menu.

    There are three more menu items available. Those are the EDITOR, SETOPT
and COMPILE menus.  The EDITOR brings up your editor with your BASIC source
code to edit.  SETOPT sets all system options according to what has been
appended previously to the source file by the ANNOTATE command.  COMPILE gets
you to the actual compile/link process.



                            INSTALLING MAKEPDQ

    MAKEPDQ is really just an interface between you and your compiler.  It
does not compile or link.  It passes your choices to the compiler and linker,
so you will need to set up the MAKEPDQ.CNF configuration file to suit your
own drive and directories.

    Any declaration files such as PDQDECL.BAS should reside in the directory
you start MAKEPDQ from.

    All other ancillary files such as *.LIB, _*.OBJ and STR*.OBJ should be in
a single directory as defined in the MAKEPDQ.CNF configuration file.  If the
ancillary files are located in the current directory when MAKEPDQ is run,
this line may be left blank after the equal sign in the configuration file.

    The MAKEPDQ.COM and MAKEPDQ.CNF files may be located in any directory
that is accessible via your system PATH.



                    MAKEPDQ.CNF - THE CONFIGURATION FILE

    The configuration file is heavily commented: check it before you start
to be sure everything will be okay for your system.  There are paths to fill
in that will most certainly be different for your own system.  Once you have
modified MAKEPDQ.CNF, I suggest you delete the REM lines to speed up program
execution.

    It is not mandatory that MAKEPDQ.CNF reside in the same directory as the
MAKEPDQ program, as long as it is accessible via your system PATH.



                             USING MAKEPDQ

    Before using MAKEPDQ you must compile and link it as follows:

       bc makepdq /o/s ;
       link /ex/nod/noe/far/packc makepdq +
          _kill _locate _noerror _noread _noval _pdqval,, nul, [basic7] pdq ;

    Then, to start MAKEPDQ type MAKEPDQ PROGNAME, where PROGNAME is the name
of a BASIC source file (you do not type in the .BAS extension).  If PROGNAME
does not exist, MAKEPDQ will prompt you to create it; if you ask to create
the file, MAKEPDQ will write the following three lines to the file:

    'PROGNAME.BAS
    DEFINT A-Z
    '$INCLUDE: 'PDQDECL'

    You will be presented with a Lotus-style menu bar.  Use your keyboard
keys as follows:

    Esc                 - Quit MAKEPDQ
    Left/Right arrows   - Highlight the menu item you want
    Down arrow          - Open the highlighted menu window
    Up/Down arrows      - Scroll bar once a pull-down menu has been opened
    Enter               - Open the highlighted menu window, or close an
                          already open window.
                          NOTE: When the COMPILE pull down menu is open,
                          pressing Enter initiates the compiling process.
    Space Bar           - Select/de-select the highlighted option

Additional notes:

    1. The EDIT and SETOPT menu items have a short-cut key, which is the
       down-arrow key.  It is assumed that when one of these two menu items
       is highlighted and you press the down-arrow key, you want to execute
       the command instead of opening the corresponding window.  This feature
       can be defeated by modifying MAKEPDQ.BAS as indicated in the listing.

    2. You can jump from an open window to the next without having to first
       close the current window.  Just use the left/right arrow keys.



                             SELECTING OPTIONS

    You will notice that some options are pre-selected.  Those may be
considered as "default" options, and are those I use mostly all the time.
They may be de-selected if you want.

    In the STRING window, you can of course select only one string pool file
at a time.  MAKEPDQ will automatically de-select any other selected file as
you select a new one.

    The ANNOTATE option in the COMPILE window is an option that will append
your compiling options to the BASIC source file.  This lets you see what
compile and link options were used later, and allows the SETOPT option to
set all the system options automatically when you have to recompile your
program in the future.  See the end of MAKEPDQ.BAS for an example of how
this is done.

    The EXE2COM option in the COMPILE window uses the EXE2COM.COM program
included with the PDQ distribution disks.

    The REN TO COM option merely renames your .EXE file to a .COM

    The LZEXE option is used to archive your executable file.  The resulting
file is much smaller and only takes a fraction of a second to decompress at
runtime.  Try it!  But you will need a copy of LZEXE.EXE which is largely
available as shareware on phone BBS's everywhere.  You may also use any of
the other executable file archivers available.  See MAKEPDQ.CNF for an
example of how to effect this change.



                               SPECIAL NOTES

    Instead of shelling to DOS to execute the compiler and the linker,
MAKEPDQ uses Interrupt 21h, function 4Bh so it has access to the exit codes
from those programs.  This is how MAKEPDQ knows if there has been an error
from the compiler or the linker.  If there was no error, the .OBJ file is
deleted.  If there has been an error in the linking process, the .OBJ file
is not deleted so that you can re-link without having to re-compile.

    MAKEPDQ.COM will show up in color on a color monitor but it will display
normally on a monochrome monitor as well.  At this time, the colors are not
configurable.  If you wish to change the program colors, you will have to
edit the source code and recompile.
