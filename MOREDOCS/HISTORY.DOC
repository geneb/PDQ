MONSETUP.ASM                4-10-92
Added Uses CX to the procedure definition because a user reported that his
screwy '286 BIOS trashed CX (which screwed up WindowPrint and WindowPrintCR).

R$CORE.ASM                  3-5-92
Rob added extra code to make popping up safer.

B$FVAL.ASM, EMULATOR.ASM, FP_MATH.ASM, and FPI36_37.ASM     4-25-92

DOLLAR$.ASM                 7-30-92

works correctly with or without the _STR$.OBJ stub file.

_CPRINT.ASM                 8-28-92
Added Uses SI to the B$PSSD Proc declaration which should have been there.

New case-insensitive version of the Sort routine -- for near strings only!

SORT.BAS                    9-25-92

than just ignore the blank and continue as it had been doing.

GETCPU.ASM                  11-25-92
Added some mysteriously missing lines that used to be there (??) to solve
a crashing problem on 386- and 486-equipped computers.

TSRFILE.ASM                 11-27-92
Rob juggled the code around to use the TSR's PSP when handling DTA calls, to
fix a problem with TSR programs that swapped to EMS memory.

Added support for VB/DOS.  Additions include the VBDOS.ZIP and VBSOURCE.ZIP
distribution files which hold the libraries and source code, respectively,
for files related to VB/DOS.  Also added are new library files: PDQVBDOS.QLB
and PDQVBDOS.LIB, and two new response files: QUICKVBD.RSP and PDQVBDOS.RSP.

Besides support for VB/DOS P.D.Q. now honors several BASIC graphics commands.
Non-static string functions are also supported now, although not with VB/DOS.
See the README and README.VBD files for full information.  The newly added
assembly language source files are:

  EXITSFUN.ASM
  LINE.ASM
  LPOS.ASM
  PALETTE2.ASM and PALETTEU.ASM
  PCOPY.ASM
  PLOT.ASM
  POINT1.ASM, POINT2.ASM, and POINTS.ASM
  PSET.ASM

CLOSE.ASM                   12-24-92
Added code to skip trying to close a file if it is not open.  Before this fix
using CLOSE with no arguments did not try to close unopen files, but CLOSE
with one or more specific file numbers did.  This fix was not applied to the
SMALLDOS version of CLOSE.ASM to keep the code size as small as possible.

SWAPDISK.ASM, ENVIRON2.ASM, and ENVIRON3.ASM   12-24-92
Made VB/DOS versions by adding code to copy incoming literals to a temporary
variable if necessary.

*.BAS                       1-25-93
Added one or more line numbers to all of the BASIC TSR and interrupt handler
demonstration programs to accommodate VB/DOS.  See README.VBD for the reason.
^------------------------------ Version 3.10 ------------------------------^

KEYSUBST.BAS                4-9-93
New TSR demo that shows how to exchange modifier keys.  Thanks to Matt Hart.

EXITSFUN.ASM                5-19-93
Changed 2nd from last line from Pop BX to Pop AX, since string functions must
return their descriptor address in AX.
^------------------------------ Version 3.11 ------------------------------^

SHELDISK.ASM                10-14-93
New SHELL routine swaps the main program to disk, also returns the exit code.

BUFIN.ASM                   11-4-93
Myrna Larson moved some code to guarantee that Done is cleared each time.

_CPRINT.ASM                 12-16-93
Changed the test to not print any control characters in color to distinguish
only CHR$(8), CHR$(10), and CHR$(13).

KEYCOUNT.BAS                12-21-93
New demo TSR that shows how to read and reset the number of keys pressed from
a foreground application.

CHDRIVE.ASM (VB/DOS version)    2-19-94
Fixed a bug where AX returned from P$FixStr was assigned to [BP+04] when it
should have been assigned to [BX+04].

MACRO.BAS                   3-13-94
Added to header comments showing how to use a non-extended key as a trigger.
^------------------------------ Version 3.12 ------------------------------^

R$CORE.ASM, R$IVT.ASM, R$SWAP.ASM, and SWAPDISK.ASM
Miscellaneous improvements as noted in the files' header revision comments.
^------------------------------ Version 3.13 ------------------------------^

INTRPT.ASM (only, not INTRPTX.ASM)  7-18-96
Added code to test for DOS interrupts 25h and 26h (read/write disk sectors)
and pop the flags that DOS stupidly leaves on the stack.

READDBL.ASM and READSNGL.ASM        8-22-96
Added Push/Pop SI around the procedure code, to fix a bug that happened when
reading/inputting FP values in a FOR loop.
^------------------------------ Version 3.14 ------------------------------^
